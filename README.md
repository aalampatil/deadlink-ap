# DeadLink

A deadline submission management service. Users get a placeholder link they can share immediately — before their actual submission is ready. When the submission is ready, they map it to the placeholder and anyone with the link gets the real content.

---

## How It Works

```
1. User creates a placeholder link  →  deadlink.app/s/abc123
2. User shares that link publicly (in emails, docs, portfolios etc.)
3. User finishes their submission
4. User maps the real submission URL to their placeholder
5. Anyone visiting deadlink.app/s/abc123 now gets redirected to the real content
```

No broken links. No "coming soon" pages. The placeholder link always works.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com) account for auth
- A Cloudinary account for file uploads

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aalampatil/deadlink-ap.git
cd deadlink-ap/server
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `server/`:

```env
PORT=3000

# PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/deadlink

# Clerk
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
```

For production, create `.env.production` with the same keys pointing to your production databases.

### Run Databases with Docker

```bash
# PostgreSQL
docker run -d \
  --name deadlink-pg \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=deadlink \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16-alpine

```

Or with Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: deadlink
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  pg_data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Generate migrations from schema
npm run db:generate

# Run migrations (dev)
npm run db:migrate

# Run migrations (production)
npm run db:migrate:prod
```

### Run Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server starts with hot reload via `tsc-watch` — any TypeScript change recompiles and restarts automatically.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Scripts

| Script                    | Description                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`             | Start dev server with hot reload     |
| `npm run build`           | Compile TypeScript to `dist/`        |
| `npm run start`           | Run compiled production server       |
| `npm run db:generate`     | Generate SQL migrations from schema  |
| `npm run db:migrate`      | Run migrations (dev)                 |
| `npm run db:migrate:prod` | Run migrations against production DB |
| `npm run db:studio`       | Open Drizzle Studio to inspect DB    |

## Authentication

Auth is handled by [Clerk](https://clerk.com). Users sign in via Clerk and all protected routes require a valid Clerk session token — no password management needed.

---

## Storage

PostgreSQL (via Drizzle) stores link metadata, ownership, mappings, and status.

Cloudinary stores uploaded files. The database keeps each uploaded file's secure URL and public ID so it can be served and deleted later.
